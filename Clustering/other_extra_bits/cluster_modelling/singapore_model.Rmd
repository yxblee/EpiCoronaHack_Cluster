## Modeling initial Singapore data

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(deSolve)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## Introduction

This is an implementation and exploration of the susceptible-exposed-infectious (SEI) model in Wu et al, Lancet, https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30260-9/fulltext to Singapore outbreak of the 2019 novel corona virus. Code based on Caroline Colijn's recreation of Wu et al's analysis. 

## Data
```{r}
singapore <- read_csv("data/singapore_ncov_2019.csv")
head(singapore)
tail(singapore) #lots of rows with only NAs at the end; will need to figure out how many and remove them
glimpse(singapore)
colSums(is.na(singapore)) #There are 949 NAs in CaseID, and every case should have an ID, so use this to remove extra columns at end of imported object
singapore <- singapore[!is.na(singapore$CaseID), ] #As of Feb 19, 2020 there should be 84 cases
```

## Data cleaning
Need to change dates to date format and determine what is the earliest possible date of start of infection in Singapore
```{r}
singapore$date_onset_symptoms <- dmy(singapore$date_onset_symptoms)
singapore$presumed_infected_date <- dmy(singapore$presumed_infected_date)
singapore$date_confirmation <- dmy(singapore$date_confirmation)

min(singapore$date_onset_symptoms, na.rm = T)  # "2020-01-20"; but there are NAs - can impute from presumed infected date and/or date of confirmation
min(singapore$presumed_infected_date, na.rm = T)  # "2020-01-18"; but there are NAs
min(singapore$date_confirmation, na.rm = T) # "2020-01-23"; no NAs 
```

Add a new column to provide the numeric day since the outbreak started in Singapore, where the start date is based on the first presumed date of infection
```{r}
singapore <- mutate(singapore, days_since_outbreak = as.numeric(presumed_infected_date - min(presumed_infected_date, na.rm = T)))
```

Group data per day since outbreak to give the number of cases per day
*NOTE* this automatically removes missing data if no date of presumed infected date 
*TODO* consider imputing data using confirmation date MINUS mean incubation period; should be pretty straight forward using mutate and an if_else statement (i.e. if value is not na, use that, otherwise impute as per formula)
```{r}
sp_daily = data.frame(day=0:max(singapore$days_since_outbreak, na.rm = T),  xd = vapply(0:max(singapore$days_since_outbreak, na.rm = T), 
  function(x) sum(singapore$days_since_outbreak == x, na.rm = TRUE),
 FUN.VALUE = 1)) 
```

## ODE specification
Parameters for Singapore:

Start date = date of first presumed infected date = Jan 18, 2020
End date = Feb 19, 2020
zt = 0 because no source of zoonotic infections (only human to human)
S = Population Singapore = 5,638,700 people
E = 0
I = 2; don't hard code?? for now, based on Singapore data there are 2 cases presumed to be infected on Dec
N = 5,638,700 people (found from online source, from 2018)
DL = mean latent period = 6 (from CC's implementation of Wu's model)
DI = mean infectious period = 8.4 - 6 (from CC's implementation of Wu's model)
Lsi == Lsi = outbound air passengers (departures) from Singapore (to all countries) = 2,525,462 / 31 days = 81466.52 = 81467 per day
Lis == Lis = inbound air passengers (arrivals) to Singapore (from all countries) = 2,714,369 / 31 days = 87560.29 = 87560 per day
Air departures/arrivals are from https://data.gov.sg/dataset?q=Changi+Airport from Jan 2018
Lwc = NA in Singapore as no finer resolution than country
Lcw = NA in Sinapore as no finer resolution than country

If want to include time-varying factors, include
fw = Force of new introductions from Wuhan (up until Jan 23rd when travel ban took effect); ignore for now and just start with the two introductions 
ban = what happens if Singapore starts a travel ban?


```{r}
sp_model <- function(t, state, pars) {
  with(c(as.list(state), pars), {     # make it so we can use variable and par names
# No source of zoonotic infections
# No modeling of within Singapore travel as data is at the country level and infections should be spreading from the two initial cases and/or additional imported cases
#    LcwT = LcwT*travelban(t) # 1 or 0 # we should add the travelban, control measures 
#    LwcT = LwcT*travelban(t) # 1 or 0 # as anotther time-dep function
    dSdt = -(S/N)*((R0/DI)*I) + Lis - (1/N)*(Lsi)*S
#    dSdt = -(S/N)*((R0/DI)*I) + Lis - (1/N)*(Lsi*0.98)*S  #Ex of potential hard code way to continue to introduce new infections throughout the outbreak; recall Lsi will have to add up to 1 across all compartments; so here only 98% of incoming travelers are still sucesptible the other 2% are in E and I categories
    dEdt = (S/N)*((R0/DI)*I) -E/DL - (1/N)*(Lsi)*E
#    dEdt = (S/N)*((R0/DI)*I) -E/DL - (1/N)*(Lsi)*E  #Ex of intro new infections during outbreak
    dIdt = E/DL - I/DI - (1/N)*(Lsi)*I
#    dIdt = E/DL - I/DI - (1/N)*(Lsi*0.01)*I  #Ex of intro new infections during outbreak, at a rate of 1% of incoming travellers are infected (I think?)
    list(c(dSdt, dEdt, dIdt))
  })
}
```

Now specify the starting state, the time range, the parameters and the input functions. Wu et al modelled new introductions of cases each day, but we are assuming for the moment that Singapore cases all came from the original 2 cases. 

```{r}
i_state = c(S = 5638700, E = 0, I = 2)
times = seq(0,50, by=0.1) 

pars=list(N = 5638700, 
          DL = 6, 
          R0 = 2.6, 
          DI = 8.4 - 6, 
          Lsi = 81467, 
          Lis = 87560)
```

Run the model
```{r}
out <-  as.data.frame(ode(y= i_state, times=times, func=sp_model, parms=pars))

out$realtime <- out$time + min(singapore$presumed_infected_date, na.rm = T)

ggplot(data = out, aes(x = realtime,y = E)) +
      geom_line() 
```
Basically, this is exponential growth...

## How does the prediction of exponential growth compare with the data from Singapore?
To do this we need to set up the necessary functions for a likelihood model, and define the (negative log) likelihood.

```{r}
sp_loglike = function(out, pars, sp_daily) {
  # get lambda_d from 'out' which is the model output 
  ld <- vapply(sp_daily$day, function(x) getlambd(out, pars, x), FUN.VALUE = 1)
  return( sum((-ld) + sp_daily$xd*(log(ld)) - log(factorial(sp_daily$xd))))
  } 

# this function computes lambda_d in Wu et al, for the days specified in our wufinal (or ccwufinal - offset for our alternative starting time)
modelpreds = function(out, pars, sp_daily) {
 ld <- vapply(sp_daily$day, function(x) getlambd(out, pars, x), FUN.VALUE = 1)
 return(data.frame(day = sp_daily$day, prediction = ld, data = sp_daily$xd))
}

getlambd <- function(out, pars, day) {
  try(if(var(diff(out$time)) >0.005) {  stop("approx integral assumes equal time steps")} )
 try(if( max(out$time) < day) {stop("model simulation is not long enough for the data") })
   if (day == min(out$time)) {ii =  which(out$time >= day & out$time < day + 1)
   } else {   ii = which(out$time > day-1 & out$time <= day) }

  dx <- out$time[ii[2]]-out$time[ii[1]]
ft <- with(pars , {(Lsi/N)*(out$E[ii] + out$I[ii])})
return(0.5 * (dx) * (ft[1] + 2*sum(ft[2:(length(ft) - 1)]) + ft[length(ft)]))
}

# returns NEG of log likelihood
negloglike = function(R0, pars, sp_daily, my_state, times) {
  pars$R0 <-  R0
  out <- as.data.frame(ode(y = my_state, times=times, func=sp_model(), parms=pars))
  return(-sp_loglike(out, pars, sp_daily)) 
  # NOTE optim will minimize by default, min ( -loglike) = max (log like)
}
```


Make a plot showing the data and the model predictions. By eye, the prediction is too low at the start of the epidemicfor the data. 
Perhaps we can maximize the likelihood to estimate the $R_0$ value, start with a larger number for I at the initial state, and/or start the outbreak at an earlier time.
```{r}
mypars <- list(N = 5638700, 
               DL = 6,
               R0 = 2.6, 
               DI = 8.4 - 6, 
               Lsi = 81467, 
               Lis = 87560,
               startTime = mdy("Jan 18, 2020"),
               endTime = mdy("Feb 19, 2020"))

out = as.data.frame(ode(y= i_state, times=times,  func=sp_model, parms=mypars))

mp = modelpreds(out, mypars, sp_daily) %>% gather(Source, casecounts, prediction:data)

ggplot(data=mp, aes(x=day,y=casecounts,color=Source))+geom_point() #
```


We can use optim to estimate $R_0$ here. Wu et al used a Bayesian approach but CC used a maximum likelihood approach. 

```{r}
i_state = c(S = 5638700, E = 0, I = 2)
myfit <- optim(2.5, 
              function(R0) negloglike(R0, pars, sp_daily, my_state = i_state, times))
  # Keeps returning an error: 'Error in as.list(state) : argument "state" is missing, with no default'
  #I've tried renaming state to my_state (as argument name) and i_state (for initial values) but still get this error re: can't find "state" and I'm unsure where the issue is; it seems that the issue is in turning the ode output into a dataframe using the as.data.frame function
  #Ran out of time for troubleshooting

myfit <- optimize(f = function(R0) negloglike(R0, pars, sp_daily, state, times),
                  interval = c(0, 20))

myfit <- optim(2.5, negloglike, pars, sp_daily, state, times)

myfit_Brent <- optim(2.5, 
                     function(R0) negloglike(R0, pars, sp_daily, state, times),
                     method = "Brent")
```
